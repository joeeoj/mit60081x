# Probability and the Art of Modeling Uncertainty

## Probability

* fraction of times
* between 0 and 1
* impossible event = prob 0
* event that always happens = prob 1

In general (in this course) when we model uncertainty we are going to assume there is some **underlying experiment**.

An event happens with probability q where q is between 0 and 1 inclusive `q âˆˆ [0,1]` if in a massive number of repeats in the underlying experiment the fraction of times the events happens is _roughly_ q.

More repeats will make it so the fraction of times the event occurs gets closer to q.

### The law of large numbers

> ... the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed. The LLN is important because it guarantees stable long-term results for the averages of some random events. [1][large_nums]

### Weather forecasting

But not all underlying events can be repeated like weather forecasting

Today vs tomorrow...can't repeat yesterday, (un)fortunately

modeling uncertainty is a bit of an art...
