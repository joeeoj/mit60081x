# Events

## Examples of probability models

Two coin flips has four possible outcomes:

1. (H, H)
2. (H, T)
3. (T, H)
4. (T, T)

ℙ(HH) = 1/4 = ℙ(HT) = ℙ(TH) = ℙ(TT)

An event is a subset of possible outcomes Ω

A: 2nd flip is T (1/2)

B: at least one of the flips is H (3/4)

C: HH (single element)

> Generally speaking it's best to choose a sample space that is as simple as possible for modeling what we care about solving. For example, if we were rolling a six-sided die, and we actually only care about whether the face shows up at least 4 or not, then it's sufficient to just keep track of two outcomes, "at least 4" and "less than 4".
