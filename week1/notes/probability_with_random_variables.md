# Probability with random variables

Example: 3 coin flips:

{HHH, HHT, HTH, HTT, THH, THT, TTH, TTT}

X = number of H

ЁЭСе = {0, 1, 2, 3}

X(HTH) = 2

![r.v. labeling](rv_labeling.png)

When we write `X = ЁЭСе` for any value what we are really thinking of is a set of outcomes such that the labeling of these outcomes is equal to a particular value of x (set of outcomes = event)

`X = ЁЭСе -> {X = ЁЭСе} = {╧Й: X(╧Й) = ЁЭСе}`

P<sub>x</sub>(ЁЭСе) = тДЩ(X = ЁЭСе) = тДЩ({╧Й: X(╧Й) = ЁЭСе})

P<sub>x</sub>(ЁЭСе) = Probability mass function (PMF)
