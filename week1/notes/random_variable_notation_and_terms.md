# Random Variables Notation and Terminology

Random variables will be denoted with capital letters -> `W and I`

Specific instantiations will be denoted with lower case letters

`W` probability table:

Another way to think of it: _W as the "world" of possibilities_

| Œ©     | ‚Ñô   |
| ----- | --- |
| sunny | 1/2 |
| rainy | 1/6 |
| snowy | 1/3 |

The probability table for r.v `W` is denoted as P<sub>W</sub>

P<sub>W</sub><sup>(w)</sup> = `‚Ñô(W = w)`

P<sub>W</sub><sup>(sunny)</sup> = 1/2

`I` probability table:

| Œ©    | ‚Ñô   |
| ---- | --- |
| 1    | 1/2 |
| 0    | 1/2 |

The prob table for r.v. `I` is denoted as P<sub>`I`</sub>

P<sub>`I`</sub><sup>(i)</sup> = `‚Ñô(I = i)`

P<sub>`I`</sub><sup>(1)</sup> = 1/2

### Probability mass function (PMF)

In general for a r.v. X, P<sub>X</sub> = (probability table = probability mass function (PMF) = probability distribution)

0 ‚â§ P<sub>X</sub><sup>ùë•</sup> ‚â§ 1

and the sum of all possible outcomes of P<sub>X</sub><sup>ùë•</sup> = 1

_Function as a map_
