# Probability with Events

Two coin flip example continued:

A: 2nd flip = T or {HT, TT}

B: at least one coin flip is T or {HH, HT, TH}

C: both flips are HH or {HH}

Event A occurs if we see an outcome in set A `ω ∈ A`

Each time you run a random experiment there can be only one outcome but multiple events can happen at the same time.

## Probability of an event

Probability of event A is the sum over all outcomes in the event set.

ℙ(A) = Σ(ω ∈ A) ℙ(ω)

ℙ(A) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2
